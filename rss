    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today marks my last day at &lt;a href="https://stripe.com"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;, where I’ve been working for the past three months on their &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-open-source-retreat"&gt;open source retreat&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to believe that it’s been a whole three months. I’ve literally never worked this long in one place before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On my first day, I had been living in California for less than a week. I knew no one who worked here, and my plans consisted of fulfilling a grant proposal. Three months later, I’ve accomplished everything I said I would: I’ve written a new &lt;a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo"&gt;dependency resolver&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://cocoapods.org/"&gt;CocoaPods&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Resolver-Integration-Specs"&gt;language-agnostic test suite&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/3257"&gt;working port&lt;/a&gt; of my resolver (named Molinillo) to &lt;a href="http://bundler.io/"&gt;bundler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also had an incredible time working out of Stripe’s office: they’ve fed me, provided excellent company, and have shown me that even big companies can have spirit and be fun places. I’ve met amazing people working here, people who have been gracious enough to share their wisdom over coffee runs and meals in the cafeteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no words for how grateful I am that Stripe granted me this opportunity. Without them, I would never have been able to move to San Fransisco and live out my dream of being a professional open source developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must also thank my fellow CocoaPods core contributors for both encouraging me to apply for the retreat, and also helping me with my work here every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, Thanksgiving might have been a week ago, but I really do want to give thanks for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It was a great three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am so incredibly happy to announce today that I will be joining the fine folks at &lt;a href="http://realm.io"&gt;Realm&lt;/a&gt; starting on Monday. I’ll be working on building cool things there—&lt;a href="http://cocoapods.org"&gt;CocoaPods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/realm/jazzy"&gt;jazzy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit"&gt;RestKit&lt;/a&gt;, along with working on Realm, the database, itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the past three months at &lt;a href="https://stripe.com"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;, working full-time on CocoaPods thanks to their amazing &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-open-source-retreat"&gt;open source retreat&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, I’ve discovered a few things. I love working on open source tooling—it’s maybe the most fun type of problem I’ve ever tried to tackle. I also miss working in the same room as my coworkers. At Realm, I get the best of both worlds: working on an amazing open source product with an incredible, world-class team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to continue working on the projects I already contribute to, and I’m sure there’ll be new projects soon enough. Realm is building some incredible technology, and I have no worries that it’ll be an interesting product to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sad to say goodbye to Stripe. They’ve fed me well and I’ve made many wonderful friends there, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more excited to begin the next period of my life at Realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excelsior.&lt;/em&gt; Things just keep getting better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I Never Write Singletons</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a rash of discussion about singleton use on Twitter in the past few days, largely between &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/indragie"&gt;@indragie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattt"&gt;@mattt&lt;/a&gt;. I want to throw my 2¢ into the ring, squarely on the &lt;em&gt;anti-&lt;/em&gt;singeton side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t stand the use of &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt; singletons because they make class dependency graphs hidden inside their implementations, rather than explicit via publically declared properties. In doing so, any class becomes allowed to pull in any other part of your application&amp;rsquo;s stack and use it, meaning classes will easily snake their way into all corners of your system. Take my word for it: that means &lt;strong&gt;hell&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, your application might not ever create more than one instance of a given class &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, and sure, that instance might effectively share a lifetime in common with your application as a whole. But are those things you ever want to depend upon? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Use dependency injection and pass instances along to the objects that use them. Don&amp;rsquo;t do that just because it makes testing easier (it does) or because it makes your headers more descriptive (it really and truly does).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, avoid explicit singletons because they make your codebase &lt;em&gt;incredibly brittle&lt;/em&gt;. They couple your interaction and instantiation models in such a way that your application flow becomes assumed all over the place. They also set in stone conditions that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be presently true, and ensure that it&amp;rsquo;ll be a nightmare for them to ever change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, back to the title of this post: why I never &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; singletons. Singletons are abound in the Cocoa world, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we have to treat them as singletons (everything I wrote above holds for &lt;code&gt;UIApplication&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NSFileManager&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NSNotificationCenter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NSPersistantStore&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t ever write shared global accessor methods for my objects (any more), since it tempts me to presume that some random component of my application is perfectly justified in accessing a &lt;code&gt;sharedInstance&lt;/code&gt; of whatever class. That temptation is very real, but it&amp;rsquo;s a temptation that, with experience, I know is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global state is inherent in the application programming environment we use, right down to the hardware, but we never need to presume that there&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;lsquo;singleton&amp;rsquo; of anything. Imagine if the authors of schedulers said &amp;#39;oh, there will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be more than one core for processes to execute on&amp;rsquo;. Probably sounded reasonable at some point, but it, of course, turned out to be a completely invalid assumption. Just create instances where appropriate and pass them along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a case where &lt;code&gt;sharing != caring&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On Class Methods</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://blog.segiddins.me/2014/09/27/class-methods/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Class methods, aka those declared with a &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; in Objective-C, are horribly misused. In most languages I deal with, there is a difference between methods and functions&amp;ndash;functions are used either as a map in the mathematical sense, or to imperatively perform an action, while methods are bound to a given &amp;lsquo;receiver&amp;rsquo;, and thus the actions they expose are something the &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt; they are invoked on performs, and any map they represent is a transformation of that object into one of its properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times, I see classes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="highlight objective_c"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NSObject&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;baseURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nonatomic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NSURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;baseURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSHTTPURLResponse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;@end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See that &lt;code&gt;+baseURL&lt;/code&gt; method? I don&amp;rsquo;t like it. It implies that the URL it returns is somehow an attribute of the &lt;code&gt;API&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt;, whereas that property clearly belongs on the &lt;em&gt;instance&lt;/em&gt;, as evidenced by that &lt;code&gt;@property&lt;/code&gt; declaration. By associating that method with the class, you are breaking the encapsulation of the instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another abuse of class methods I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is the association of &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; maps with a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="highlight objective_c"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;NSObject&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;hashForRequest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSURLRequest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSDate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;requestTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Presumably OAuth request signing, etc.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;@end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;+hashForRequest&lt;/code&gt; method doesn&amp;rsquo;t represent an intrinsic property of an &lt;code&gt;API&lt;/code&gt; object, nor does it represent some behavior that an &lt;code&gt;API&lt;/code&gt; object would be able to &amp;#39;customize&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;instead, it takes a set of given inputs, and returns an output that depends only upon those inputs. Sound familiar? It&amp;rsquo;s a function. Therefore, it should be represented in code as a function rather than a method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;n.b.&lt;/em&gt; when a subclass would have reason to override the method, then it&amp;rsquo;s probably correct for it to be a method.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, these two misuses of class methods don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily harm a program &lt;em&gt;as originally written&lt;/em&gt;, but by improperly encapsulating data, behavior, and maps, this code structure becomes brittle. It means that the different pieces of your program aren&amp;rsquo;t where they ought to be (or where I&amp;rsquo;d expect them to be), which can lead to more detrimental issues in your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I started work at &lt;a href="http://tumblr.com/"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time in my life, I&amp;rsquo;m working on a team. Not only am I working on a team of iOS  developers, but they are incredible. I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying the hours that I spend at work, but there&amp;rsquo;s ultimately something missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m one of twenty-two (I think?) interns, but none are on my team. I like all of the people I work with, but they&amp;rsquo;re all older than me, and it shows. They all have people to go back to at the end of the day; they have lives outside of work. At the moment, I don&amp;rsquo;t. I have an apartment in Little Italy, but all my friends are back in Chicago or in Scarsdale. I&amp;rsquo;m in my favorite city in the world, less than a mile and a half from the coolest office I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked in, and yet it still feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href="http://blog.segiddins.me/2014/06/17/a-time-of-changes/"&gt;jumped off a cliff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I haven&amp;rsquo;t hit the ground yet. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will until September, when I pack up again. And I think that&amp;rsquo;s part of the problem. I&amp;rsquo;m on my own for the first time, and I can&amp;rsquo;t even settle down because I&amp;rsquo;m uprooting again so soon. I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly excited to be facing these new frontiers, but it&amp;rsquo;s still scary. Going off the beaten path means it isn&amp;rsquo;t obvious what I should be doing. It means I don&amp;rsquo;t know who to turn to when things don&amp;rsquo;t feel right. Hell, it means I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what&amp;rsquo;s supposed to feel right. I know that, generally speaking, I&amp;rsquo;m headed in the right direction. But there are just so many new things facing me; I&amp;rsquo;m unsure of how to make all the little things fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I found out I was leaving college for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I&amp;rsquo;m not dropping out. No, nothing bad happened. Yes, I promise it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr: I&amp;rsquo;m working at &lt;a href="http://tumblr.com"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; this summer, moving to San Francisco in September to work at &lt;a href="https://stripe.com"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://cocoapods.org"&gt;CocoaPods full-time&lt;/a&gt; for three months, and in the process taking a year off of school. See &lt;a href="http://blog.cocoapods.org/Stripe-Open-Source-Retreat/"&gt;my announcement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/blog/open-source-retreat-grantees"&gt;Stripe&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In less than a week, I start work at &lt;a href="http://tumblr.com"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, working on our awesome iOS app. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier to be working with an incredible team, filled with people that I admire and trust, and generally just &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;. Like all good things, however, it will come to an end (I say before it even begins). See, I&amp;rsquo;m only there as a sumer intern. After summer internships usually comes school. Which is where this announcement comes in: &lt;em&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t be returning to UChicago in September&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m moving to San Fransisco for a year, and will be returning to UChicago as part of the class of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me backtrack for a moment. Back at the end of March, right before returning to Chicago for spring quarter, I went to the &lt;a href="http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Bug-Bash/"&gt;CocoaPods Bug Bash&lt;/a&gt; at the Artsy office in NYC. While I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to commit any code that day, I started to see how CocoaPods worked. And I liked what I saw. I also really liked the people I interacted with, both on IRC and on the issues (and of course &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/orta"&gt;Orta&lt;/a&gt;, whom I met in person). When I got back to school, I started submitting pull requests to the various CocoaPods repos. The first one I submitted was an (all-nighter) attempt to port the &lt;a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/2039"&gt;Bundler iterative resolver&lt;/a&gt; into CP. It was a failed attempt, but it got me talking with the CocoaPods Core team; it also got me contributing more and more. I think there was a two week stretch where I very nearly had a pull request a day. Needless to say, I was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after, I joined the Core team myself; then my friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blakewatters"&gt;Blake&lt;/a&gt; pointed me towards &lt;a href="https://stripe.com"&gt;Stripe&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; recently announced &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-open-source-retreat"&gt;Open Source Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. I joking said to the rest of the CocoaPods team that maybe I would consider applying, expecting them to laugh it off. Except they didn&amp;rsquo;t. They stood behind me 100% as I contemplated taking a leave of absence from school to work on open source software and move out to SF (which has long been a dream of mine). Whilst attending the &lt;a href="http://rubymotion.com"&gt;RubyMotion&lt;/a&gt;#inspect conference, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alloy"&gt;Eloy&lt;/a&gt; helped me polish up a proposal. I sent it in the last day possible, and promptly moved on to working on finals stuff, anticipating that, as a nineteen year old, I would be promptly ignored by the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more wrong. A mere three days after I had sent in my proposal, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thegdb"&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt; let me know that I was accepted as a grantee. Holy shit. The night before my last day of classes of the year, I had found out that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going back in September with the rest of my friends. While I was, of course, estatic at the opportunity that lays in front of me, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dare ask for more, this has been a bittersweet couple of weeks for me. Last year, I wrote a bit about &lt;a href="http://blog.segiddins.me/2013/06/20/moving-on/"&gt;moving on&lt;/a&gt;, but I expected it would be several more years before I had to really do it again. I was wrong. It was three weeks short of a year since I wrote that post. I had to say goodbye to some of the most incredible friends I&amp;rsquo;ve made over the past year at UChicago, as well as leaving behind a lifestyle to which I&amp;rsquo;d adapted myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the mid-week study breaks (the cheesy tots will be missed, Sam!), gone are the 3am nights in the Salisbury house lounge, gone are the dinnertime Foucault debates, gone are the marathon study sessions in the library, gone are the countless hours spent with some of my favorite people in the world. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m heading out for a new adventure. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled and exhilarated and excited, but at the same time I know that there are things that I am leaving behind. Even though I won&amp;rsquo;t be partaking in those things for the next year, however, they won&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; be gone: my experience over the past year have profoundly shaped me as a person. I&amp;rsquo;m not the same Samuel that walked into Burton-Judson in September, 2013. I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that I&amp;rsquo;m now more ready for the world, that college so far has prepared me by showing me that the &amp;lsquo;life of the mind&amp;rsquo; is really a part of who I am and the life that I live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, flying from Midway to LaGuardia one last time (don&amp;rsquo;t ask why, it&amp;rsquo;s been a 2000 mile day), I am struck by an intense sense that my life is moving in the right direction. I&amp;rsquo;m embarking on an incredible journey, and I have three amazing years of college education ahead of me. I am beyond thankful for this opportunity, and also all of the unbelievable experiences that I&amp;rsquo;ve been a party to this past year. I&amp;rsquo;m at 38,000 feet, and damn if things don&amp;rsquo;t look great right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past several months, I have been working as the Lighting Designer on the &lt;a href="https://college.uchicago.edu/uttaps-present-sleuth"&gt;UT production of Sleuth&lt;/a&gt;. It was my twentieth major theatrical production, and very likely my last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to thank the amazing production team for letting me go out in style. Sure, it was (at times) an incredibly stressful process, and there was an abundance of sleepless nights for us all, but in the end we put on a show that had us saying, &amp;lsquo;No fucking way they allowed us to do this.&amp;rsquo; Guess what: we did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to work with an incredible director, whose vision for the show guided us through broken glasses, creepy sailor laughs, and lots of sidelight. It was a blast.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done any of it without my Master Electrician. He put up with me adding crazy tower positions and using a par as a special. He wired up a desk lamp with LED strips. He helped me focus when I got behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our actors were also a treat to work with. &lt;em&gt;UT/TAPS Presents: Brotanks&lt;/em&gt; will never be forgotten. You made a two and a half hour show entertaining, simultaneously gut-wrenching and hilarious. Even though you guys forgot lines and broke stuff, you made the show come to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving theater is bittersweet, it was always going to be. All I can say is that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have picked a better production to end on.
Here comes one last &lt;em&gt;fade to black&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, Aristotle claims that &amp;ldquo;presumably, being a good person is not in every case the same as being a good citizen&amp;rdquo; (Aristotle 1130b). Although he makes this claim, it actually runs contrary to Aristotle’s definition of &amp;lsquo;goodness&amp;rsquo; (and its attainment) as depicted throughout the &lt;em&gt;Ethics&lt;/em&gt;. It may appear from his use of two distinct terms (and the definitions he gives to differentiate them) that these are distinct categories, but in fact, virtuous citizenship may be considered the fulfillment of one&amp;rsquo;s personhood. For Aristotle, being a good human being and a good citizen are synonymous, as he conceives man to be a fundamentally social being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aristotle offers definitions of both classifications, of “person” and “citizen,” but what is missing is the effect that living in a society has on one’s thoughts about life in society. He defines a person as human being, who possesses social capacities and the ability to reason far beyond levels observed in any animal, whereas a citizen is a free member of a society, bound by its laws and customs, and is in search of that which is good for him. In this manner, a man&amp;rsquo;s personhood is what gives him his basic capacities and appetites, but it is his citizenship that motivates him towards the good, as well as providing a solid framework under which he may both achieve the good and measure his own achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussion of virtues, the means by which man strives toward the good, Aristotle says, &amp;ldquo;Let us leave the nutritive capacity aside, since by nature it plays no role in human virtue&amp;rdquo; (Aristotle 1102b) because the nutritive capacity is one that is not unique to man, but rather &amp;ldquo;such a capacity of the soul [exists] in everything that takes in nutrition&amp;rdquo; (Aristotle 1102b). What sort of capacity can man fulfill when he is alone? Undoubtedly he would be fighting to fulfill those same nutritive capacities that Aristotle excludes from consideration in human virtue. In explaining the nature of virtue as a state, Aristotle says, &amp;ldquo;The virtue of a human being too will be the state that makes a human being good and makes him perform his characteristic activity well&amp;rdquo; (Aristotle 1106a). What, then, is man&amp;rsquo;s characteristic activity? As Aristotle tries to explain, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If&amp;hellip; we take the characteristic activity of a human being to be a
certain kind of life; and if we take this kind of life to be activity of
the soul and actions in accordance with reason, and the characteristic
activity of the good person to be to carry this out well and nobly, and
a characteristic activity to be accomplished well when it is
accomplished in accordance with the appropriate virtue&amp;hellip; the human good
turns out to be activity of the soul in accordance with virtue&amp;quot;
(Aristotle 1098a). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this definition of man&amp;rsquo;s characteristic activity does not seem to set out any simple metric by which we can measure that activity&amp;rsquo;s fulfillment by a person. Working backwards, from what Aristotle describes as virtuous it is possible to deduce what man&amp;rsquo;s characteristic activity might be. What aspects do the various virtues that Aristotle describes have in common? Courage, temperance, generosity, magnificence, greatness of soul, even temper, friendliness, truthfulness, wit, justice, and friendship all share a necessity in a second party, exterior to the practitioner. Thus, the existence of fellow man is essential for achieving virtue, and therefore is required for any single human to be good. Man’s characteristic activity must be the good and happiness, for those are the characteristics of a virtuous man, as a virtuous man, by his nature, is accomplished in the characteristic activities of humankind. Beyond the characteristic activities of any being, however, are the fundamental characteristics that define man’s natural dispositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aristotle says that man is, by nature, a &amp;#39;political animal&amp;rsquo;, and since he sees political science as the study of the good of the city, it would seem that man is a social being, one that is most at home in a society. Thus, the question that must be answered in order to determine whether, under Aristotelian ethics, there exists a distinction between a good human being and a good citizen: is there a human existence outside of society that can be virtuous? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s conception of man&amp;rsquo;s fulfillment, it becomes clear that every man must live an existence within society, as society, or rather citizenship, is the characteristic activity of man. Describing virtue within the context of society, Aristotle claims, &amp;ldquo;For praise is indeed appropriate to virtue, since it makes us the kind of people to perform noble actions&amp;rdquo; (Aristotle 1101b). Here, Aristotle is drawing a link between what others think and one&amp;rsquo;s own propensity towards virtue. Note that &amp;#39;praise&amp;rsquo; does not encourage virtue, but rather &amp;#39;it makes us the kind of people&amp;rsquo; that are likely to &amp;#39;perform noble actions.&amp;rsquo; The emphasis is on the fact that praise is capable of fundamentally altering one&amp;rsquo;s disposition: the knowledge that society&amp;rsquo;s opinion is on the side of virtue causes people to become nobly-inclined. Similarly, scorn, or the threat thereof, is sufficient to redirect a man onto a course of virtue. This creates a feedback loop that is essential for society to function: citizens make each other into more virtuous men by applying praise and scorn when it is called for. In the realm of relationships, however, Aristotle positions friendship as an even stronger motivator for virtuous action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing friendship, Aristotle again delineates humans from their animal counterparts by the reasons that each tends to live with others of its own species. Whereas most all animals live together merely for reproductive purposes, &amp;ldquo;human beings live together&amp;hellip; also to supply what they need for life. From the start, their characteristic activities are divided&amp;rdquo; (Aristotle 1162a), and so the characteristic activity of mankind as a whole must be the sum of each individual&amp;rsquo;s characteristic activities. Just as a man and a woman naturally have divided characteristic activities, and thus require each other in order to be virtuous in the conception of a child, so too does man in general require various partners to do good things in the other areas of human characteristic activities. In other words, living together (the enabling factor for friendship) is also what provides man with the opportunity to be virtuous. Extrapolating, the sum of man&amp;rsquo;s characteristic activities could be roughly described as citizenship, and the fulfillment of those characteristic activities as virtuous citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this focus on citizenship, one could argue that a man could be in a society of one, a citizen in aim of only himself, and that would be sufficient for him to be able to be virtuous and happy. But Aristotle does comment that &amp;ldquo;happiness obviously needs the presence of external goods as well&amp;rdquo; (Aristotle 1099a), and these &amp;#39;external goods&amp;rsquo; (‘goods’ in the sense of good deeds, rather than objects) are found in other people. Just as praise and scorn point citizens towards virtue, so too can others enable a potential for happiness, which comes about when one has lived a virtuous life. As Aristotle admits, those with more possessions are more capable of higher forms of virtue. A poor man cannot be magnificent nor great-souled, as he does not have the means, but a wealthy or well-connected individual is capable of touching many people&amp;rsquo;s lives simultaneously. The edifices of magnificence are never built alone, but rather rely on the assistance of great multitudes of men to realize. It is in this manner that &amp;#39;external goods&amp;rsquo; can contribute to happiness, as the goods of others allow one to achieve these higher forms of virtue. Ultimately, Aristotelian virtue always entails multiple people: someone to be virtuous towards, someone to have made the object being given, or most often, both. In other words, it is impossible for a solitary man to be able to be virtuous, as his life will be consumed by mere sustenance; he will have no time to dedicate to more virtuous tasks, nor the resources to construct anything great—he would be living a nearly animal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although he does not delve deeply into a definition of happiness, Aristotle does outline its defining characteristics in the &lt;em&gt;Ethics&lt;/em&gt;. This outline portrays happiness as a truly human capacity and trait: it is dependent upon civilization, good fortune, and persistent choice. In the end, happiness is the first principle of the human existence, and virtue is the human means to that end. Because Aristotle does construct an ethical system under which all virtues are not considered equal, there are certain circumstances that can make attainment of happiness, the fulfillment of the human mission, nearly impossible, and almost all of those conditions are associated with solitude (such as having no one lesser to help, no previous knowledge to contemplate, etc.). In his writing, Aristotle has detailed a system under which the individual and the collective can (and must) live together harmoniously, for the one depends on the other to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/em&gt; details a world in which every man is intrinsically also a citizen, as there is no conception of human fulfillment that can be achieved when one is truly alone. Aristotle, much like the Thoreaus of modern times who wish to leave civilization behind, is unable to comprehend that his entire worldview is colored by the fact that he himself is a fundamentally societal creature. Even if he were to leave Athens behind and live alone in the wilderness, Aristotle would carry with him the skills and knowledge that society had impressed upon him. In that sense, his citizenship would be maintained through ingrained and indestructible ties back to society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being members of society, we are unable to even conceive of a life that is truly solitary, because from birth we carry the marks of our society. Those marks are what distinguishes man from animal: man is continually ‘standing on the shoulders of giants,’ improving on what others have done, being habituated with lessons that ancestors had to learn the hard way. In the end, the question of whether being a good human being is separable from being a good citizen is irrelevant, for as long as a man is lives within a society, being a human being and a citizen are irreducibly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Division of Labor and the Paradox of Innovation</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt;, Adam Smith makes contradictory arguements about innovation and education in relation to the division of labor between Books I and V. In Book I, Smith contends that the division of labor is both a natural and necessary consequence of man&amp;rsquo;s innate propensity for exchange, as well as a practice that leads to innovation by the worker due to his close association with such a particular task. In Book V, Smith claims that this very tight binding between a man and his trivial engagement so deprives the man of his mental faculties that he becomes a &amp;lsquo;degenerate&amp;rsquo;. On the one hand, Smith posits that the division of labor is able to manifest great material wealth through its promotion of inovation, while on the other claiming that the division of labor destroys a man&amp;rsquo;s capacity to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having established the concept of the division of labor, Smith lays out its three fundemental benefits as being improved dexterity at the worker&amp;rsquo;s given task, time savings due to lack of context switching, and the application of the worker&amp;rsquo;s innovative talents towards improving his simple process.  After presupposing the division of labor, he immediately jumps to the extremity of its application-namely, a world in which every worker has been charged with performing one or two very specific and unskilled actions. He claims that &amp;ldquo;men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of attaining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed towards that single object&amp;rdquo; (9) because of the sheer amount of time that man spends in front of that task. He argues that the singular focus the worker can have because of the division of labor enables him to &amp;#39;discover&amp;rsquo; innovations that make his work easier, an idea he attempts to reinforce with an untrue story of one such innovation, one ascribed entirely to the division of labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conception of the division of labor as a force towards innovation is directly contradicted in Book V by the notion that division of labor corrupts the mind of the worker and limits his mental capacities. According to Smith&amp;rsquo;s theory of the division of labor, improved dexterity in a field can be solely attributed to the sheer number of hours spent on a singular task. However, he also equates that amount of time spent on menial undertakings with an extreme atrophying of the mind, that there is &amp;ldquo;no occasion [for the worker] to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur&amp;rdquo; (840) because the worker has lost all sense both of the context in which his parcel of work is performed, and of the concept that his labor can, in fact, be replaced by an easier means of production. It is precisely because he has become so adept at performing his singular task that the worker is unable to conceive of any innovations that would make his task easier, or his occupation obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Smith himself believes that the innovations necessary for the division of labor to be successful are more frequently found among the barbaric societies that do not exist at a level of life beyond subsistence. having concluded that man&amp;rsquo;s capacity for innovation is stifled in a civilized society, he then posits that &amp;ldquo;it is otherwise in the barbarous societies&amp;hellip; [where] invention is kept alive&amp;rdquo; (840), precisely because the hunter must be able to switch between contexts, and have a broad range of general knowledge in all of those tasks which he must maintain some level of proficiency in order to survive. In other words, the hunter is able to innovate because he is not bound by the shackles of the division of labor. Why, then, is he unable to innovate his way towards a society of divided labor? It is here that Smith&amp;rsquo;s base contradiction is encountered. It is impossible for the division of labor to stifle innovation so much, yet be able to foster the innovations that make its presence beneficial. From the opposite perspective, it is likewise impossible for man in the barbarous society to be more capable of innovation, yet be unable to apply those innovations towards a society of divided labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the fundemental contradiction in &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; arises simpy because Smith has no conception of &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; division of labor, nor a conception of any position interposed between that of the unskilled laborer and that of the master. Just as he understands that supply and demand must eventually coincide at an equilibrium point, so too must the need for unskilled labor and the need for innovation settle at a happy medium. Lacking the perspective provided by the industrial revolution, Smith has no concept of the value of the immaterial innovations that he professes to be such a key component of the benefits of the division of labor. This perspective introduces the concepts of automation and permanent gains in productivity that reduce the amount of labor-power that is spent upon the most menial of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
