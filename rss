    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I found out I was leaving college for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I&amp;#39;m not dropping out. No, nothing bad happened. Yes, I promise it&amp;#39;s an amazing thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr: I&amp;#39;m working at &lt;a href="http://tumblr.com"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; this summer, moving to San Fransisco in September to work at &lt;a href="https://stripe.com"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://cocoapods.org"&gt;CocoaPods full-time&lt;/a&gt; for three months, and in the process taking a year off of school. See &lt;a href="http://blog.cocoapods.org/Stripe-Open-Source-Retreat/"&gt;my announcement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/blog/open-source-retreat-grantees"&gt;Stripe&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In less than a week, I start work at &lt;a href="http://tumblr.com"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, working on our awesome iOS app. I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier to be working with an incredible team, filled with people that I admire and trust, and generally just &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;. Like all good things, however, it will come to an end (I say before it even begins). See, I&amp;#39;m only there as a sumer intern. After summer internships usually comes school. Which is where this announcement comes in: &lt;em&gt;I won&amp;#39;t be returning to UChicago in September&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, I&amp;#39;m moving to San Fransisco for a year, and will be returning to UChicago as part of the class of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me backtrack for a moment. Back at the end of March, right before returning to Chicago for spring quarter, I went to the &lt;a href="http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Bug-Bash/"&gt;CocoaPods Bug Bash&lt;/a&gt; at the Artsy office in NYC. While I didn&amp;#39;t manage to commit any code that day, I started to see how CocoaPods worked. And I liked what I saw. I also really liked the people I interacted with, both on IRC and on the issues (and of course &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/orta"&gt;Orta&lt;/a&gt;, whom I met in person). When I got back to school, I started submitting pull requests to the various CocoaPods repos. The first one I submitted was an (all-nighter) attempt to port the &lt;a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/2039"&gt;Bundler iterative resolver&lt;/a&gt; into CP. It was a failed attempt, but it got me talking with the CocoaPods Core team; it also got me contributing more and more. I think there was a two week stretch where I very nearly had a pull request a day. Needless to say, I was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after, I joined the Core team myself; then my friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blakewatters"&gt;Blake&lt;/a&gt; pointed me towards &lt;a href="https://stripe.com"&gt;Stripe&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; recently announced &lt;a href="https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-open-source-retreat"&gt;Open Source Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. I joking said to the rest of the CocoaPods team that maybe I would consider applying, expecting them to laugh it off. Except they didn&amp;#39;t. They stood behind me 100% as I contemplated taking a leave of absence from school to work on open source software and move out to SF (which has long been a dream of mine). Whilst attending the &lt;a href="http://rubymotion.com"&gt;RubyMotion&lt;/a&gt;#inspect conference, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alloy"&gt;Eloy&lt;/a&gt; helped me polish up a proposal. I sent it in the last day possible, and promptly moved on to working on finals stuff, anticipating that, as a nineteen year old, I would be promptly ignored by the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, I couldn&amp;#39;t have been more wrong. A mere three days after I had sent in my proposal, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thegdb"&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt; let me know that I was accepted as a grantee. Holy shit. The night before my last day of classes of the year, I had found out that I wasn&amp;#39;t going back in September with the rest of my friends. While I was, of course, estatic at the opportunity that lays in front of me, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t dare ask for more, this has been a bittersweet couple of weeks for me. Last year, I wrote a bit about &lt;a href="http://blog.segiddins.me/2013/06/20/moving-on/"&gt;moving on&lt;/a&gt;, but I expected it would be several more years before I had to really do it again. I was wrong. It was three weeks short of a year since I wrote that post. I had to say goodbye to some of the most incredible friends I&amp;#39;ve made over the past year at UChicago, as well as leaving behind a lifestyle to which I&amp;#39;d adapted myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the mid-week study breaks (the cheesy tots will be missed, Sam!), gone are the 3am nights in the Salisbury house lounge, gone are the dinnertime Foucault debates, gone are the marathon study sessions in the library, gone are the countless hours spent with some of my favorite people in the world. Instead, I&amp;#39;m heading out for a new adventure. I&amp;#39;m thrilled and exhilarated and excited, but at the same time I know that there are things that I am leaving behind. Even though I won&amp;#39;t be partaking in those things for the next year, however, they won&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; be gone: my experience over the past year have profoundly shaped me as a person. I&amp;#39;m not the same Samuel that walked into Burton-Judson in September, 2013. I&amp;#39;d like to think that I&amp;#39;m now more ready for the world, that college so far has prepared me by showing me that the &amp;#39;life of the mind&amp;#39; is really a part of who I am and the life that I live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, flying from Midway to LaGuardia one last time (don&amp;#39;t ask why, it&amp;#39;s been a 2000 mile day), I am struck by an intense sense that my life is moving in the right direction. I&amp;#39;m embarking on an incredible journey, and I have three amazing years of college education ahead of me. I am beyond thankful for this opportunity, and also all of the unbelievable experiences that I&amp;#39;ve been a party to this past year. I&amp;#39;m at 38,000 feet, and damn if things don&amp;#39;t look great right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past several months, I have been working as the Lighting Designer on the &lt;a href="https://college.uchicago.edu/uttaps-present-sleuth"&gt;UT production of Sleuth&lt;/a&gt;. It was my twentieth major theatrical production, and very likely my last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to thank the amazing production team for letting me go out in style. Sure, it was (at times) an incredibly stressful process, and there was an abundance of sleepless nights for us all, but in the end we put on a show that had us saying, &amp;#39;No fucking way they allowed us to do this.&amp;#39; Guess what: we did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to work with an incredible director, whose vision for the show guided us through broken glasses, creepy sailor laughs, and lots of sidelight. It was a blast.
I couldn&amp;#39;t have done any of it without my Master Electrician. He put up with me adding crazy tower positions and using a par as a special. He wired up a desk lamp with LED strips. He helped me focus when I got behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our actors were also a treat to work with. &lt;em&gt;UT/TAPS Presents: Brotanks&lt;/em&gt; will never be forgotten. You made a two and a half hour show entertaining, simultaneously gut-wrenching and hilarious. Even though you guys forgot lines and broke stuff, you made the show come to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving theater is bittersweet, it was always going to be. All I can say is that I couldn&amp;#39;t have picked a better production to end on.
Here comes one last &lt;em&gt;fade to black&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/em&gt;, Aristotle claims that &amp;quot;presumably, being a good person is not in every case the same as being a good citizen&amp;quot; (Aristotle 1130b). Although he makes this claim, it actually runs contrary to Aristotle’s definition of &amp;#39;goodness&amp;#39; (and its attainment) as depicted throughout the &lt;em&gt;Ethics&lt;/em&gt;. It may appear from his use of two distinct terms (and the definitions he gives to differentiate them) that these are distinct categories, but in fact, virtuous citizenship may be considered the fulfillment of one&amp;#39;s personhood. For Aristotle, being a good human being and a good citizen are synonymous, as he conceives man to be a fundamentally social being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aristotle offers definitions of both classifications, of “person” and “citizen,” but what is missing is the effect that living in a society has on one’s thoughts about life in society. He defines a person as human being, who possesses social capacities and the ability to reason far beyond levels observed in any animal, whereas a citizen is a free member of a society, bound by its laws and customs, and is in search of that which is good for him. In this manner, a man&amp;#39;s personhood is what gives him his basic capacities and appetites, but it is his citizenship that motivates him towards the good, as well as providing a solid framework under which he may both achieve the good and measure his own achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussion of virtues, the means by which man strives toward the good, Aristotle says, &amp;quot;Let us leave the nutritive capacity aside, since by nature it plays no role in human virtue&amp;quot; (Aristotle 1102b) because the nutritive capacity is one that is not unique to man, but rather &amp;quot;such a capacity of the soul [exists] in everything that takes in nutrition&amp;quot; (Aristotle 1102b). What sort of capacity can man fulfill when he is alone? Undoubtedly he would be fighting to fulfill those same nutritive capacities that Aristotle excludes from consideration in human virtue. In explaining the nature of virtue as a state, Aristotle says, &amp;quot;The virtue of a human being too will be the state that makes a human being good and makes him perform his characteristic activity well&amp;quot; (Aristotle 1106a). What, then, is man&amp;#39;s characteristic activity? As Aristotle tries to explain, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If... we take the characteristic activity of a human being to be a
certain kind of life; and if we take this kind of life to be activity of
the soul and actions in accordance with reason, and the characteristic
activity of the good person to be to carry this out well and nobly, and
a characteristic activity to be accomplished well when it is
accomplished in accordance with the appropriate virtue... the human good
turns out to be activity of the soul in accordance with virtue&amp;quot;
(Aristotle 1098a). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this definition of man&amp;#39;s characteristic activity does not seem to set out any simple metric by which we can measure that activity&amp;#39;s fulfillment by a person. Working backwards, from what Aristotle describes as virtuous it is possible to deduce what man&amp;#39;s characteristic activity might be. What aspects do the various virtues that Aristotle describes have in common? Courage, temperance, generosity, magnificence, greatness of soul, even temper, friendliness, truthfulness, wit, justice, and friendship all share a necessity in a second party, exterior to the practitioner. Thus, the existence of fellow man is essential for achieving virtue, and therefore is required for any single human to be good. Man’s characteristic activity must be the good and happiness, for those are the characteristics of a virtuous man, as a virtuous man, by his nature, is accomplished in the characteristic activities of humankind. Beyond the characteristic activities of any being, however, are the fundamental characteristics that define man’s natural dispositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aristotle says that man is, by nature, a &amp;#39;political animal&amp;#39;, and since he sees political science as the study of the good of the city, it would seem that man is a social being, one that is most at home in a society. Thus, the question that must be answered in order to determine whether, under Aristotelian ethics, there exists a distinction between a good human being and a good citizen: is there a human existence outside of society that can be virtuous? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Aristotle&amp;#39;s conception of man&amp;#39;s fulfillment, it becomes clear that every man must live an existence within society, as society, or rather citizenship, is the characteristic activity of man. Describing virtue within the context of society, Aristotle claims, &amp;quot;For praise is indeed appropriate to virtue, since it makes us the kind of people to perform noble actions&amp;quot; (Aristotle 1101b). Here, Aristotle is drawing a link between what others think and one&amp;#39;s own propensity towards virtue. Note that &amp;#39;praise&amp;#39; does not encourage virtue, but rather &amp;#39;it makes us the kind of people&amp;#39; that are likely to &amp;#39;perform noble actions.&amp;#39; The emphasis is on the fact that praise is capable of fundamentally altering one&amp;#39;s disposition: the knowledge that society&amp;#39;s opinion is on the side of virtue causes people to become nobly-inclined. Similarly, scorn, or the threat thereof, is sufficient to redirect a man onto a course of virtue. This creates a feedback loop that is essential for society to function: citizens make each other into more virtuous men by applying praise and scorn when it is called for. In the realm of relationships, however, Aristotle positions friendship as an even stronger motivator for virtuous action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing friendship, Aristotle again delineates humans from their animal counterparts by the reasons that each tends to live with others of its own species. Whereas most all animals live together merely for reproductive purposes, &amp;quot;human beings live together... also to supply what they need for life. From the start, their characteristic activities are divided&amp;quot; (Aristotle 1162a), and so the characteristic activity of mankind as a whole must be the sum of each individual&amp;#39;s characteristic activities. Just as a man and a woman naturally have divided characteristic activities, and thus require each other in order to be virtuous in the conception of a child, so too does man in general require various partners to do good things in the other areas of human characteristic activities. In other words, living together (the enabling factor for friendship) is also what provides man with the opportunity to be virtuous. Extrapolating, the sum of man&amp;#39;s characteristic activities could be roughly described as citizenship, and the fulfillment of those characteristic activities as virtuous citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this focus on citizenship, one could argue that a man could be in a society of one, a citizen in aim of only himself, and that would be sufficient for him to be able to be virtuous and happy. But Aristotle does comment that &amp;quot;happiness obviously needs the presence of external goods as well&amp;quot; (Aristotle 1099a), and these &amp;#39;external goods&amp;#39; (‘goods’ in the sense of good deeds, rather than objects) are found in other people. Just as praise and scorn point citizens towards virtue, so too can others enable a potential for happiness, which comes about when one has lived a virtuous life. As Aristotle admits, those with more possessions are more capable of higher forms of virtue. A poor man cannot be magnificent nor great-souled, as he does not have the means, but a wealthy or well-connected individual is capable of touching many people&amp;#39;s lives simultaneously. The edifices of magnificence are never built alone, but rather rely on the assistance of great multitudes of men to realize. It is in this manner that &amp;#39;external goods&amp;#39; can contribute to happiness, as the goods of others allow one to achieve these higher forms of virtue. Ultimately, Aristotelian virtue always entails multiple people: someone to be virtuous towards, someone to have made the object being given, or most often, both. In other words, it is impossible for a solitary man to be able to be virtuous, as his life will be consumed by mere sustenance; he will have no time to dedicate to more virtuous tasks, nor the resources to construct anything great—he would be living a nearly animal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although he does not delve deeply into a definition of happiness, Aristotle does outline its defining characteristics in the &lt;em&gt;Ethics&lt;/em&gt;. This outline portrays happiness as a truly human capacity and trait: it is dependent upon civilization, good fortune, and persistent choice. In the end, happiness is the first principle of the human existence, and virtue is the human means to that end. Because Aristotle does construct an ethical system under which all virtues are not considered equal, there are certain circumstances that can make attainment of happiness, the fulfillment of the human mission, nearly impossible, and almost all of those conditions are associated with solitude (such as having no one lesser to help, no previous knowledge to contemplate, etc.). In his writing, Aristotle has detailed a system under which the individual and the collective can (and must) live together harmoniously, for the one depends on the other to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/em&gt; details a world in which every man is intrinsically also a citizen, as there is no conception of human fulfillment that can be achieved when one is truly alone. Aristotle, much like the Thoreaus of modern times who wish to leave civilization behind, is unable to comprehend that his entire worldview is colored by the fact that he himself is a fundamentally societal creature. Even if he were to leave Athens behind and live alone in the wilderness, Aristotle would carry with him the skills and knowledge that society had impressed upon him. In that sense, his citizenship would be maintained through ingrained and indestructible ties back to society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being members of society, we are unable to even conceive of a life that is truly solitary, because from birth we carry the marks of our society. Those marks are what distinguishes man from animal: man is continually ‘standing on the shoulders of giants,’ improving on what others have done, being habituated with lessons that ancestors had to learn the hard way. In the end, the question of whether being a good human being is separable from being a good citizen is irrelevant, for as long as a man is lives within a society, being a human being and a citizen are irreducibly the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Division of Labor and the Paradox of Innovation</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt;, Adam Smith makes contradictory arguements about innovation and education in relation to the division of labor between Books I and V. In Book I, Smith contends that the division of labor is both a natural and necessary consequence of man&amp;#39;s innate propensity for exchange, as well as a practice that leads to innovation by the worker due to his close association with such a particular task. In Book V, Smith claims that this very tight binding between a man and his trivial engagement so deprives the man of his mental faculties that he becomes a &amp;#39;degenerate&amp;#39;. On the one hand, Smith posits that the division of labor is able to manifest great material wealth through its promotion of inovation, while on the other claiming that the division of labor destroys a man&amp;#39;s capacity to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having established the concept of the division of labor, Smith lays out its three fundemental benefits as being improved dexterity at the worker&amp;#39;s given task, time savings due to lack of context switching, and the application of the worker&amp;#39;s innovative talents towards improving his simple process.  After presupposing the division of labor, he immediately jumps to the extremity of its application-namely, a world in which every worker has been charged with performing one or two very specific and unskilled actions. He claims that &amp;quot;men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of attaining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed towards that single object&amp;quot; (9) because of the sheer amount of time that man spends in front of that task. He argues that the singular focus the worker can have because of the division of labor enables him to &amp;#39;discover&amp;#39; innovations that make his work easier, an idea he attempts to reinforce with an untrue story of one such innovation, one ascribed entirely to the division of labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conception of the division of labor as a force towards innovation is directly contradicted in Book V by the notion that division of labor corrupts the mind of the worker and limits his mental capacities. According to Smith&amp;#39;s theory of the division of labor, improved dexterity in a field can be solely attributed to the sheer number of hours spent on a singular task. However, he also equates that amount of time spent on menial undertakings with an extreme atrophying of the mind, that there is &amp;quot;no occasion [for the worker] to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur&amp;quot; (840) because the worker has lost all sense both of the context in which his parcel of work is performed, and of the concept that his labor can, in fact, be replaced by an easier means of production. It is precisely because he has become so adept at performing his singular task that the worker is unable to conceive of any innovations that would make his task easier, or his occupation obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Smith himself believes that the innovations necessary for the division of labor to be successful are more frequently found among the barbaric societies that do not exist at a level of life beyond subsistence. having concluded that man&amp;#39;s capacity for innovation is stifled in a civilized society, he then posits that &amp;quot;it is otherwise in the barbarous societies... [where] invention is kept alive&amp;quot; (840), precisely because the hunter must be able to switch between contexts, and have a broad range of general knowledge in all of those tasks which he must maintain some level of proficiency in order to survive. In other words, the hunter is able to innovate because he is not bound by the shackles of the division of labor. Why, then, is he unable to innovate his way towards a society of divided labor? It is here that Smith&amp;#39;s base contradiction is encountered. It is impossible for the division of labor to stifle innovation so much, yet be able to foster the innovations that make its presence beneficial. From the opposite perspective, it is likewise impossible for man in the barbarous society to be more capable of innovation, yet be unable to apply those innovations towards a society of divided labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the fundemental contradiction in &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; arises simpy because Smith has no conception of &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; division of labor, nor a conception of any position interposed between that of the unskilled laborer and that of the master. Just as he understands that supply and demand must eventually coincide at an equilibrium point, so too must the need for unskilled labor and the need for innovation settle at a happy medium. Lacking the perspective provided by the industrial revolution, Smith has no concept of the value of the immaterial innovations that he professes to be such a key component of the benefits of the division of labor. This perspective introduces the concepts of automation and permanent gains in productivity that reduce the amount of labor-power that is spent upon the most menial of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Marx contends that political economy leads to the acceptance of &amp;quot;the lowest possible level of life (existence) as the standard&amp;quot; (95) by which life is judged. This statement is predicated upon the idea that &amp;quot;light, air, etc.--the simplest animal cleanliness--ceases to be a need for man&amp;quot; (94), an idea that flies in the face of the basic tenets of political economy, namely that the division of labor necessarily leads to more people having cheaper and easier access to resources of all sorts. Light and air are still needs for man, but the advancement of society has enable them to be taken as given, such that this &amp;#39;lowest possible level&amp;#39; cannot even be taken as the baseline to judge human existence. The ability of the masses to purchase that which Marx claims is derided as luxury (for the examples we used in class: fridges, toasters, and cars), combined with the fact that such goods have become the new minimum level considered a standard demonstrates that man has in fact moved on from striving to satisfy his primal needs. His standard of existence has been ever rising. It is entirely possible that there is some other cost to man that must be borne to make this march of progress possible, but it is undeniable that man has progressed to the point where, for the masses, light and air and warm shelter, are so easily attainable so as not to be worries. For this reason, the assertion that, to the political economist, &amp;quot;every luxury of the worker seems to be reprehensible&amp;quot; (95) is ludicrous. The political economist heralds the fact that luxury is no longer out of the reach of the worker, that what once was luxury is now the lowest that the masses can sink. While it is entirely possible that man has lost something on the journey to this point, the standards by which life is judged are forever rising.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In his theory on the wages of labor, Smith contends that the balance of power in negotiation for wages is firmly on the side of the masters. To begin with, he posits that &amp;quot;the workmen stand in need of a master to advance them&amp;quot; (75) both the requisite materials to perform their work, as well as enough wages to constitute subsistence for the worker&amp;#39;s family. Coupled with the landlord&amp;#39;s superior ability to endure a period without profit (76), Smith&amp;#39;s view of the role of business can be seen as an expression of one of the benefits of a civilized society over a rude one: wealth will still be able to &amp;#39;trickle down&amp;#39; even in tough times. The cost of this stability for the worker is, however, apparent: &amp;quot;in all such [labor] disputes the masters can hold out much longer&amp;quot; (76), making striking (or other forms of work stoppage) ultimately more costly to the strikers than the employers (as the workers can seldom end up victorious). Smith does not see this imbalance of power as a flaw, even as he admits that each party is equally reliant on the other in the long run. Rather, he believes that benefit, along with profit-making, to rightly belong to the master. In his time, however, the law prohibited &amp;quot;with so much severity  the combinations of servants, laborers, and journeymen&amp;quot; (77), so perhaps it is natural for Smith to believe it just for the master to have the clear advantage in combination. For the master, it is also easier to combine because of much smaller numbers, and because the tradition had reached a point where collusion had become &amp;#39;tacit&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;uniform&amp;#39;. The two reasons cited for workmen combining endure to this day: &amp;quot;the high price of provisions, sometimes the great profit which their masters make by their work&amp;quot; (77), but according to Smith, neither complaint is valid-the first because the price of provisions cannot, except in times of universal suffering, rise so high as to cause the worker to starve (the cost of course reflecting the amount of labor in their harvest), and the second because Smith has shown that the master deserves any profit he reaps from his land or his factories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearing that in mind, how would Smith react to rise (and now fall) of organized labor and the prohibitions against monopolies in current times?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meaning in Tragedy</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to &amp;quot;find meaning in tragedy&amp;quot;? After a terrible event occurs, we often hear calls for us to &amp;quot;find meaning&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;search within ourselves&amp;quot;. What does that even mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me indulge in one of my more annoying tendancies: trotting out the actual definiton of tragedy. As understood by Aristotle, a tragedy is the downfall of a person due to their inherent character flaws. Obscure? Maybe. But it is important to note that most of what the media and politicians denote as tragedies aren&amp;#39;t really, at least not in the formal sense. You see, the entire point of a Greek tragedy is that it promotes catharsis, or spiritual cleansing. From real tragedies, we are meant to derive meaning, to go back and question our assumptions about the world around us, and to come away with the knowledge of how to avoid such a downfall ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But senseless acts of violence, nor awful luck, are tragedies. That is not to say that they are not terrible, awful events, but they arent tragedies. They are the shocking reminders that the world we live in is governed largely by chance. Some get sick while others stay healthy. Some are caught at the wrong place at the wrong time, while others avoid such misfortunes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first heard of the Boston Marathon bombing, I kept prodding myself to understand what had happened. Surely, these two brothers couldn&amp;#39;t have a reason for killing and maiming innocent people they didn&amp;#39;t even know. But I was unsatisfied with my answer of &amp;#39;no reason&amp;#39;. So I kept searching. After a week of being glued to sensationalist news coverage, I can honestly say that I did not come away with a feeling of catharsis. Instead, I came away feeling lucky that my family was safe, and that there were heroes at the scene to help those not so fortunate. But I had gleaned nothing from the brothers. All they had done was commit a senseless act of cold-blooded murder. There is nothing in that part of their psyche I can identify with--and thus no meaning for me to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s not much we can learn from moments like that, besides the fact that, as difficult as it is to accept, we are subject to the whims of Lady Luck. Sometimes, we can&amp;#39;t find meaning when something terrible occurs. And that&amp;#39;s OK. There&amp;#39;s no meaning to find when you hear of students being massacred, or peaceful protesters being shot. All we can, and indeed should, do is mourn what has happened, and resolve to continue to fight for justice. We can&amp;#39;t find meaning in the senseless.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, one era of my life ended, and another began.
Tomorrow, one era of my life begins, and another ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Time moves like a river, you can either sink or swim&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy, has time moved. Four years ago, I was on the verge of leaving Middle School behind. I thought that it was going to be my introduction to the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;, entering Scarsdale High School. Never have I been so right and so wrong at the same time. So let me try and explain the past four years of my life, on the eve of my graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered high school supremely unsure of what it would mean for me. See, in middle school I was a good student, but I was never anything special. I never worked the hardest. I never cared the most. I never scored the best or worst marks on anything (save 7th grade math, where I ended up with a 112%, don&amp;#39;t ask me how). I could write, but my words were, more often then not, hollow. Following three years of middling performance, I was afraid that I would soon be weeded out once faced with the rigor of high school classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My freshman year, I faced true rigor for the first time in my life, courtesy of my honors math teacher, Mr. Azor. From the &amp;#39;rigorous definition of congruence modulo&amp;#39; to mind-bending 39 step geometry proofs, I learned to commit myself to my work as I had never done before. I started writing essays in English that I wasn&amp;#39;t embarrassed about. I started to take pride in my trumpet playing. I met two guys and formed a rock band, learning bass in the process. It was one hell of a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During finals week of my freshman year, my friend Connor introduced me to one of his friends, who shall remain nameless. She and I spent the entire summer either together, or connected via incessant text messaging. Great summer, and I&amp;#39;ll leave it at that. But after a month of school, things didn&amp;#39;t work out, so it was time to move on. That brings me to the crux of thought about graduating, and the title of tonight&amp;#39;s post: moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spend our entire live accruing memories, accumulating experiences that become etched in our minds, that we crave to relive. Sometimes, the past can be a great motivator. But at other times, it is an emotion burden that weighs us down. The past four years have left me with mountains of memories, but starting a new part of my life means that I can finally let go of the unproductive ones. Leave behind all of the useless emotional triggers that make my hometown like a minefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made some incredible friends here in Scarsdale, friends that I know I want to keep in touch with for years to come, people that I want to continue to share memories with. But moving out to Chicago and enrolling in a new school is my first chance to be selective about the baggage I carry with me. I plan on shedding the memories that I would rather forget, so that I make mental and emotional room for new ones that I hope far exceed the ones I leave behind. Moving on means compacting the vast majority of my experiences into a product: me. It means learning from success and from failure, acknowledging that the past has defined the present me, but also conceding that my future is still malleable. That moving on allows me to take a great leap forward, and accumulate four more years of life at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, moving on means that the honorifics that were bestowed upon me have to be archived, to make way for far more global actions. Sure, being a National Merit Scholar, honors student, award-winning band member, and perennial lighting designer was fun, and I enjoyed the recognition and the sense of accomplishment that these titles brought me. But it&amp;#39;s time to move on. In this next portion of my life, I hope to have a much more global impact, and clinging to my past accomplishments would be a debilitating hindrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years later, I think it&amp;#39;s time to move on. I&amp;#39;m ready for another chapter in my life, a new era where I will shape my future more than ever. But this upcoming four years was built upon the last four years. I will never forget the impact that countless teachers and friends have had on me, as I struggled to overcome the challenges inherent in the four years of high school.&lt;/p&gt;
