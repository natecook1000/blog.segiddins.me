title: DrawnByMe 1.1 Update
---
The first update to [DrawnByMe](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drawnbyme/id585420528?mt=8) is now available on the App Store! It doesn't add much, but I think it's a good step forward for the app.

So, what's new?
- New (and improved) sharing interface 
- Non-destructive image edits 
- Re-written eraser! 
- Fixed bug selecting frowny

Coming up soon is a new app written specifically for my Computer Science teacher that should be incredibly boring to 99.99% of the population. Should be a fun weekend project.
