Today, I am incredibly happy to announce the availability of my latest iPhone app, [DrawnByMe](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=585420528).

In development since early December, DrawnByMe is a great little app for doodling 

An app that makes doodling fun and simple! Want to draw a mustache on a friend? Go ahead! Add characters to a scene? Have at it! Use DrawnByMe to pass the time, and when done, save and share the drawing! Delight in a creation all your own, and enjoy the creative process, and its byproduct.

As an added bonus, you can paint with different brushes, such as smiley faces and sparkles! (A homage to a very creative friend!)

[Buy DrawnByMe](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=585420528) on the App Store, have fun with it, and help me in the creation of something even bigger...
