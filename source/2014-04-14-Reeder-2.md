I installed the [Reeder 2 for Mac Public Beta](http://reederapp.com/mac/) yesterday. When I installed it, I had over 2,000 unread news items, and this has been after months of culling my subscription list. At this moment, for the first time since I switched from Google Reader to [FeedWrangler](feedwrangler.net), I'm at 0 unread items.

I sure did miss having Reader on my Mac. This weekend has felt like a great 'welcome home' from one of my favorite apps.
