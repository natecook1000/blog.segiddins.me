<p>If you&#8217;re insane enough to be reading this, then you probably have a sinking suspicion that you don&#8217;t need to. And you&#8217;re probably right. Except I think you should stay anyway. I might not be a supergenius or a hilarious comedic, but I think I have something to offer. As such, I want you to judge me on what I post here, not who I am. Because that&#8217;s germane to the discussion. With that said, here are some of my creds:</p>

<ul style="list-style: square inside;"><li>Rising Senior in High School</li>

<li>Trumpeter, Flugelhorn player</li>

<li>Bassist, Guitarist, Singer</li>

<li>Apple Enthusiast</li>

<li>Aspiring Developer</li>

<li>Writer</li>

<li>Cynic and Pundit</li>

</ul><p>With that out of the way, let&#8217;s get started!</p>
