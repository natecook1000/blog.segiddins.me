Today, I'm really happy to announce that my third iOS app is now [available on the app store][itwh]!

Who's Here? was inspired by my Computer Science teacher, who jokingly suggested I should make an attendance-taking app, so I did!

Who's Here? is the best app for attendance taking! Whether you're chaperoning a school trip, teaching a class, or conducting a rehearsal, look no further than Who's Here? to make taking attendance quick and painless. 

You walk into class, the bell's about to ring, students are already at their seats, and you have an awesome lesson planned for the day. Do you take the half hour to log onto the network to take attendance? Of course not! You just fire up Who's Here?, go through the class roll, and off you go!
