Last week was **crazy**. I had a week to make an app for Apple's WWDC student scholarship, so I hunkered down for about *50 hours* and finally made one of my anti-social social networks: *AllAboutMe*. It's an app (and mobile service) that lets you browse a user's entire online identity (from Youtube to Pinboard to their blog).

I think it's pretty great, and will be submitting it to the app store very soon, all I have left to do is make a frontend for the service (which is hosted on Azure).
