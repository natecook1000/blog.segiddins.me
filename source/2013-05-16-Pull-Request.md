Last night, while at the NYC Postgres User Group meetup, I got an email. An automated email from Github. At first when I saw it, I figured someone had squashed a bug in one of the many open source frameworks I follow. Well, I was half right. It turns out that someone liked the work *I* had done on [RKXMLReaderSerialization](https://github.com/RestKit/RKXMLReaderSerialization/pull/3#issuecomment-17971971), and wanted to spin it off into a new project. Wow! I'm hopeful that this is the first of many contributions to open source in my future.
