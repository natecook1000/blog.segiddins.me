title: First App Store Rejection
---
Today, my third iOS app entered review. I figured that, like the first two, it would be in review for several hours and then be approved for sale. I wish. Instead, after about 35 minutes, I got a notification that my app was **Rejected**. What a slap in the face! To make matters worse, Apple's email just had a link to the resolution center. I figured I could get the reason for rejection in the iTunes Connect iPhone app. No. Had to wait until I got back to the computer to even see why my app was rejected.

The reason? It turns out that, when submitting an app with In-App Purchase, there's a new checkbox hidden in the iTunes Connect interface. All I had to do was tick that before resubmitting. Seems to me that there's room for some streamlining.

Hopefully this app will be approved before the end of the week.
