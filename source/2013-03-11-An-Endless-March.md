title: An Endless March
---
Thirst forever consumes their parched lips<br />
That pray silently for deliverance from this hell<br />
Alone in chains linking thousands<br />
Miles they cross every day with only a desolate destination<br />
<br />
For them, for us all we call this life<br />
An endless march towards nowhere<br />
Walking, retreating into deathly days nearer the abyss<br />
The shackled march on, aimless, endless<br />
<br />
Breathing out that which sustains them<br />
The fog engulfs their sight that they cannot see<br />
But for the blinding darkness that encompass all<br />
Around them the landscape turns to ashes<br />
And their sore, downtrodden feet unto dust<br />
<br />
Lift up your heads, my weary children<br />
See all the footprints behind you in the dust<br />
Relinquish the promise of the freedom of escape<br />
Give up the future for the long march ahead<br />
<br />
Eyes locked forward, fixed like the barrel of a gun<br />
You must not look upwards into the blinding sun<br />
For the you would be useless to the greater cause that lies ahead<br />
Without feet, without sight, to them you'd be better off dead<br />
<br />
My weary ones<br />
When it feels like the journey will never end<br />
You gotta hold your head high<br />
And keep pushing on<br />
Again<br />
<br />
March forward to the beating of the sun<br />
Feet blistered red by the roughshod road<br />
Tortured by master less than nature<br />
Whose harsh path you forever follow<br />
