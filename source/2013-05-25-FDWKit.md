I just pushed v0.0.1 of my latest project, [FDWKit](http://segiddins.github.io/FDWKit/), so it's now available on Github and [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org).

So, what is FDWKit? It is an Objective-C library built atop [AFNetworking](http://afnetworking.org) that makes interacting with the [FeedWrangler](http://feedwrangler.net) API a breeze. v0.0.1 is the result of about two nights work, so you can expect *many* updates and improvements down the road. Please check it out and use it in your own projects!
